# node-o3-xml

This is a C based W3C-DOM XML Library for NodeJS with XPath and namespaces. It is implemented using the C based LibXML2 and the Ajax.org O3 component system. This project is used in production in many NodeJS based backend projects for Ajax.org and updated frequently. 

To use this library simply clone the repo, and require('node-o3-xml') to return the parser object.
This repository is a generated build for node 0.2.2 stable, from the o3 repository http://github.com/ajaxorg/o3
The currently included binaries are for the following platforms:
* win32 (through cygwin)
* lin32 
* osx64
Other platforms and bit-ness (32/64) will be added to the automated build VM incrementally.
If you need to build this node-o3-xml module yourself or want to contribute to the source, please look at the main o3 repository.
